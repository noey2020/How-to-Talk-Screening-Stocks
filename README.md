Assessing a companyâ€™s general long-term prospects by scrutinizing its financial 
strength and capital structure.

The most basic possible definition of a good business is this: It generates 
more cash than it consumes. Start by reading the statement of cash flows in 
the companyâ€™s annual report. See whether cash from operations has grown steadily
throughout the past 10 years.If owner earnings per share have grown at a steady
average of at least 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable
generator of cash, and its prospects for growth are good.

Next, look at the companyâ€™s capital structure. Turn to the balance sheet to see
how much debt (including preferred stock) the company has; in general, long-term
debt should be under 50% of total capital.

Look in the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges. In the future, the company will either have to earn
much more from its operations or find a way to borrow money at lower rates. 
Analyze whether the company could end up being owned not by its shareholders 
but by its bondholders.

On dividends and dividend rates, the burden of proof is on the company to show 
that you are better off if it does not pay a dividend. If the firm has 
consistently outperformed the competition in good markets and bad, the managers
are clearly putting the cash to optimal use. Companies that repeatedly split
their shares and hype those splits in breathless press releases treat their
investors like dolts. Companies should buy back their shares when they are cheap
not when they are at or near record highs.

The more seriously investors take the per-share earnings figures as published,
the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard against accounting
factors of one kind and another that may impair the true comparability of the 
numbers. We have mentioned three sorts of these factors: the use of special
charges, which may never be reflected in the per-share earnings, the reduction
in the normal income-tax deduction by reason of past losses, and the dilution
factor implicit in the existence of substantial amounts of convertible 
securities or warrants.1 A fourth item that has had a significant effect on
reported earnings in the past is the method of treating depreciation: chiefly 
as between the straight-line and the accelerated schedules. Still another factor,
important at times, is the choice between charging off research and development
costs in the year they are incurred or amortizing them over a period of years.
Finally, let us mention the choice between the FIFO (first-in-first-out) and 
LIFO (last-in-first-out) methods of valuing inventories.

All this may be confusing and wearisome. Corporate accounting is often tricky;
security analysis can be complicated; stock valuations are really dependable 
only in exceptional cases.

In investing, as with life in general, ultimate victory usually goes to the 
doers, not to the talkers.

Another Screening Strategy!!!

There are five elements to consider scrutinizing companies.

1. The companyâ€™s general long-term prospects.
2. The quality of its management.
3. Its financial strength and capital structure.
4. Its dividend record.
5. And its current dividend rate.

We obtain five years' worth of annual reports.We generally comb through the
financial statements, gathering evidence to help you answer two overriding
questions. What makes this company grow? Where do (and where will) its
profits come from? Look if the  company is an OPM addict, borrowing debt or
selling stock to raise boatloads of Other Peopleâ€™s Money. Is its sales 
driven by just one big customer? Perform SWOT analysis.

My two cents!

I included some jupyter notebooks to serve as study guide and to practice on real python code.

I included some posts for reference.
